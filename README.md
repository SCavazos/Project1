# Project1
My first project: GO Tracker.<br>
GO Tracker is a place where Pokemon GO Trainers can log in and check their personal shiny rates. The state that my project is currently in, is for single use only. The long-term goal for this project is for Trainers to be able to log in and track their perosnal shiny rates over time, per Pokemon species.<br>
Navigate to the Kanto Region under the "Regions" tab, click on the Pokemon you would like to track and plug in your numbers.<br>
<br>
The features I'm currently showcasing are as follows:<br>
1. A navigation menu that collapses into a responsive, mobile-friendly menu through the use of Bootstrap from a CDN<br>
2. The use of media queries and Flexbox to switch my one-column, mobile layout to a three column desktop layout<br>
3. Two forms that each take in at least two fields of information and validates input<br>
4. My JS function takes in two values from the user and upon clicking the "Get My Shiny Rate" button, performs a math operation, and displays the result on the page<br>
<br>
One thing to note: My desktop-sized navigation bar displays best when using Chrome or Firefox.
